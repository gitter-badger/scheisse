# Dedda script files provide the possibility to bring intelligence into your npcs.
# See here for an example:

# walk 15.0 1.570796327
# jumpIf npc.location.x<50 loop1
# walkTo -100.0,10

# You can also use basic java script for calculating values. Reserved words like 'npc.location.x'
# from the example are escaped and replaced with the specific value.
